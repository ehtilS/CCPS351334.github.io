    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am working towards becoming a general contractor and owning a civil
      engineering business. I want to do this because of my family history of
      civil engineers and I want to become a contractor so that I can be my own
      boss.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am working towards these goals by looking for scholarships right now and
      applying for a summer internship at the Toll Brothers company that offer
      civil engineering internships. I hope that I could start early I could
      guarantee a better university that offer good civil engineering programs.
    </p>

    <p>
      The value that I value the most for my success is discipline. I try to do
      what is right at all times and to do all of my work on time.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hope that I could apply for enough scholarships for the next two years
      so that I could go to university without paying a dime. I also hope that I
      could apply for an internship and learn civil engineering from the front
      lines.
    </p>

    <p>
      The character trait I want to be known for the most is discipline. Nothing
      in my eyes is most important than discipline because it is the hard trait
      to master.
