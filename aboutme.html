    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am working towards becoming a general contractor and owning a civil engineering business. I want to do this because of my family history of civil engineers and I want to become a contractor so that I can be my own boss.
      
I am working towards these goals by looking for scholarships right now and applying for a summer internship at the Toll Brothers company that offer civil engineering internships. I hope that I could start early I could guarantee a better university that offer good civil engineering programs.

The value that I value the most for my success is discipline. I try to do what is right at all times and to do all of my work on time.

I hope that I could apply for enough scholarships for the next two years so that I could go to university without paying a dime. I also hope that I could apply for an internship and learn civil engineering from the front lines.

The character trait I want to be known for the most is discipline. Nothing in my eyes is most important than discipline because it is the hard trait to master.</p>
